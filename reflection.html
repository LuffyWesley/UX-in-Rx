                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Throughout this 10 week user-centered design project, we learned a lot about the design process, effective
                        teamwork, and the various challenges associated with designing a product or service that prioritizes
                        high-quality user experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>If we were to have done anything differently throughout this design process, we would have liked to have
                        done more user research, such as observing nurses in-action during a shift, interviewing more nurses,
                        and getting a patientâ€™s perspective as well. Our biggest challenge was the complexities involved with
                        our user group. Registered nurses have long shifts and tend to be very busy, so it was challenging to
                        do extensive amounts of user research. Registered nurses also have many pain points, so it was difficult
                        to pinpoint which pain point to design for and how to create a design solution for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our group had a big shift in focus when we were making the information architecture: we realized we were
                        doing too much with our app. This prompted us to pare down the functions of the app, and make it solely
                        about communication between nurses and patients. One of the things we learned from this process is that
                        we, as designers, have to be flexible in the design process, and not hold too tightly to one idea. We
                        found iteration to be integral to the design process. We also learned how difficult it can be to remove
                        pre-existing expectations of what a user might want or need, and instead focus on user research and what
                        the users point out as their pain points and desires. Something else that struck us is how difficult
                        it is to make things intuitive. While making our paper prototypes, wireframes, and mockups we thought
                        our designs were simple and easy to understand; however, our usability testing showed us that things
                        can seem straightforward to us, but might not make sense to others.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our team worked cohesively and efficiently. Through effective communication via Slack, we were able to spread
                        out responsibilities and ask for help when we needed it. As the quarter went on, we increasingly used
                        collaborative platforms, like Figma, to work simultaneously on our projects. We realized that this was
                        both time-saving and fun, as we could provide instant feedback or suggestions, and also see and build
                        off of the cool ideas our teammates had.
