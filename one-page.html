                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <p>Our project aims to improve communication between nurses and patients in a hospital to enable nurses to interact
                        with their patients as much as possible and provide excellent care. This product is a messaging application
                        that allows for quick and straightforward messaging between patients and nurses. The key features are:
                        access to patient records for both patients and nurses, a message inbox, differentiation between inpatient
                        and outpatient messages in a nurse’s inbox, and multiple action options for nurses replying to inpatient
                        messages. The nurses and patients will input their respective credentials to gain access to this application.
                        Our application has few pathways, and is meant to strengthen the connection between nurses and patients,
                        as well as simplify the process of messaging between the two groups in order to convey the most important
                        information.

                        <p>We worked on this project as part of an undergraduate course (Introduction to User Centered Design) at
                            the University of Washington from January until mid-March 2018.

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>When brainstorming user groups for this project, we wanted to pick a unique group that is often forgotten.
                        This is the reason we decided to design a project for nurses, since they tend to be under-appreciated
                        and underrepresented in the healthcare industry. After interviewing multiple registered nurses, we found
                        their main pain point to be that they are unable to interact with their patients as much as they would
                        like to. We found this very interesting, and aimed to focus on this pain point for our project. PocketNurse
                        is a mobile application we designed that connects nurses and patients, and allows them to easily message
                        one another. The mobile platform of this application allows for a more intimate connection to the patient,
                        as people in general tend to have a very intimate connection to their mobile phone.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>User Research</h2>
                    <p>This deliverable was the first step in our user-centered design process. The research findings include details
                        of three interviews we conducted of three registered nurses. The documents include a list of the questions
                        the interviewees were asked, each interviewee’s responses, and all references we used when brainstorming
                        questions. We conducted these interviews because we wanted to understand our users, registered nurses,
                        better, and understand what pain points and desires they have. These research findings were an important
                        first step before creating personas because we needed to first know some background about registered
                        nurses before we could create our typical user.

                    <h2>Personas</h2>
                    <p>The polished personas are a development made from the previous research findings. With the better understanding
                        we were able to get from the interviews, we were able to create to personas of who our optimal user would
                        be. Each persona contains details such as the user’s characteristics, pain points, desires, needs, and
                        comfortability with technology, as well as a short scenario describing how the pain points, desires,
                        etc. relate to one another. We created these personas to better flesh out our user group, and better
                        understand their pain points and desires. These personas were an integral step before creating the journey
                        maps, because it was crucial to develop a scenario involving our users to incorporate into our user journey
                        maps.

                    <h2>User Journey Maps</h2>
                    <p>The user journey map is a fleshed out visual depiction of a scenario that a potential user might go through.
                        This map shows a nurse’s experiences during a routine twelve-hour shift, including their actions, emotions,
                        and thoughts. We created a user journey map to help us to understand interactions from a nurse’s point
                        of view, and to visually represent their needs, desires, and goals. The user journey map stems from one
                        of our polished personas, registered nurse Jaime. Jaime’s persona provided us with the idea of whose
                        journey we were mapping, and which key points to include. Making a user journey map required us to consider
                        which pain points and desires would be important to map our in a scenario for our persona. In doing that,
                        we gained a better understanding of what nurses value, and those values informed and were included in
                        our next deliverable, the design requirements.

                    <h2>Design Requirements</h2>
                    <p>The design requirements describe what our design should include in order to satisfy the pain points, desires,
                        and needs of our users. This deliverable was necessary in our process because it allowed us to concretely
                        establish the requirements that were necessary to our design. The user journey map we previously created
                        helped us create various scenarios involving our users, which helped us to further understand the desires
                        and pain points that we wanted to design for in our project. These requirements then allowed us to create
                        even more specific scenarios for our storyboards that incorporated ways in which our design would interact
                        with our user group.

                            <li>Enable nurses to quickly and accurately record patient information to the electronic medical records.</li>

                            <li>Enable nurses to efficiently convey information to patients in a manner that they are easily able
                                to understand.</li>
                            <li>Allow nurses to easily add information and data to pre-existing patients’ records.</li>

                    <h2>Storyboards</h2>
                    <p>Creating storyboards was an integral part of our design process, as we were able to describe how the user
                        would experience our design in a more specific and detailed manner. We created six storyboards, each
                        conveying a specific experience between our design and the user, and each storyboard focuses on one of
                        the design requirements we created in the previous deliverable. Using our storyboards, we were able to
                        establish the basic structure of our design, which enabled us to complete our information architecture.

                    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
                    <p>Storyboarding gave us an understanding of how our user would interact with and flow through our design on
                        a general level. At this stage, we needed to think about the entire system and lay it out in our information
                        architecture, or sitemap. To create this sitemap, we planned out how to break down all of the high and
                        low level pages in our application. We utilized our design requirements to figure out the content and
                        flow of information for both the nurse and patient side of our application. Once we had the flow of the
                        entire system worked out, we began thinking about and sketching what each screen would look like.

                    <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
                    <p>The paper prototypes built off our information architecture by adding real screens and actions to the functions
                        we described in the information architecture. We hand-drew the screens of main pathways of our app, and
                        tested them with people not on our design team to identify interface problems. Creating paper prototypes
                        was an informative and helpful exercise that enabled our group to put our user research into a tangible
                        form. After we made our paper prototypes, we were able to evaluate them via user testing, and determine
                        what about them needed to be changed, and what about them was successful.

                    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                    <p>After creating our paper prototype, we conducted another round of user testing in which we asked our users
                        to perform specific tasks using our paper prototype. These evaluation findings detail the notes and results
                        of this user testing, which helped us understand any confusion in our design, or areas that are unintuitive.
                        These findings then enabled us to make changes to our design which we were able to incorporate into the
                        more detailed versions of our design.

                    <h2>Annotated Wireframes</h2>
                    <p>The annotated wireframes we made are low-fidelity outlines of our app that show where content goes. They
                        have annotations on them that describe the functions of aspects of the wireframes. We made these wireframes
                        to help us organize the architecture of content on the app, and to solidify what the layout of our app
                        would be. The previous deliverable we made, our experience evaluation of testing our paper prototypes,
                        helped inform our choices for the wireframes: we learned which processes were not intuitive, which icons
                        did not make sense, and what seemed important. The wireframes were a rough draft for our high-fidelity
                        mock-ups, and our classmates’ feedback on them informed us of the important aspects to incorporate in
                        our next iteration.

                    <h2>High-Fidelity Mock-ups</h2>
                    <p>For this project, the last step in the design process was creating our high-fidelity mockups. After an in-class
                        peer critique session, we selected a few screens from our low-fidelity wireframes to further design.
                        With the feedback and critiques in mind, we worked to remove the placeholders as well as solidify our
                        color scheme and layout. Creating these high-fidelity mockups helped us to convey our ideas in a more
                        complete, professional manner and brought together all the elements we have worked so hard on for the
                        past ten weeks.

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Throughout this 10 week user-centered design project, we learned a lot about the design process, effective
                        teamwork, and the various challenges associated with designing a product or service that prioritizes
                        high-quality user experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>If we were to have done anything differently throughout this design process, we would have interviewed more
                        nurses, and been in touch with them during the design process. We would also have liked to have done
                        more user research in general, such as observing nurses in-action during a shift, and getting a patient’s
                        perspective as well. Our biggest challenge was the complexities involved with our user group. Registered
                        nurses have very long shifts and tend to be very busy, so it was challenging to do extensive amounts
                        of user research. Registered nurses also have many pain points, so it was difficult to pinpoint which
                        pain point to design for and how to create a design solution for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our group had a big shift in our focus when we were making the information architecture: we realized we were
                        doing too much with our app, and that we would have to simplify it in order to better address our goal
                        of increasing the amount and quality of nurses’ interactions with their patients. This prompted us to
                        pare down the functions of the app, and make it about communication between nurses and patients, and
                        no other pairs. One of the things we learned from this 10 week process is that we, as designers, have
                        to be flexible in the design process, and not hold too tightly to one idea. We found
                        <b>iteration</b> to be an integral component of the design process. We also learned how difficult it can
                        be to remove pre-existing expectations of what a user might want or need, and instead to focus on user
                        research and what the users point out as their pain points and desires. Something else that struck us
                        is how difficult it is to make things intuitive. While making our paper prototypes, wireframes, and mockups
                        we thought our designs were simple and easy to understand; however, our usability testing showed us that
                        things can seem super straightforward to us, but might not make sense to others.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our team worked cohesively and efficiently. Through effective communication via Slack, we were able to spread
                        out responsibilities and ask for help when we needed it. As the quarter went on, we increasingly used
                        collaborative platforms, like Figma, to work simultaneously on our projects. We realized that this was
                        both time-saving and fun, as we could provide instant feedback or suggestions, and also see and build
                        off of the cool ideas our teammates had.
