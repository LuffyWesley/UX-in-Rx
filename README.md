# UX-in-Rx
Our project aims to improve communication between nurses and patients in a hospital to enable nurses to interact with their patients as much as possible and provide excellent care. This product is a messaging app that allows for quick and straightforward messaging between patients and nurses. The key features are access to patient records for both patients and nurses, a message inbox, differentiation between inpatient and outpatient messages in a nurseâ€™s inbox, and multiple action options for nurses replying to inpatient messages. The nurses and patients will input their respective credentials to gain access to the app. The app has few pathways, and is meant to simplify the process of messaging in order to convey the most important information.
